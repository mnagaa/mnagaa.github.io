## Work Experience

### 2022.04 - Current: CyberAgent, Inc., Software Engineer.

DSPの開発に従事。サーバーのパフォーマンスチューニング、データ基盤構築、クラウド最適化などを行う。クラウド、クラウドのコスト最適化、キャッシュシステムなどに詳しい。新卒向けにデータエンジニアリング、SQLの講義を担当した。

I am deeply involved in the development of DSPs (Demand Side Platforms), comprehensive tools meticulously designed to streamline the process of advertisement delivery and ensure precise audience targeting, enabling our clients to achieve peak advertising performance. My work encompasses the construction of data infrastructures leveraging Snowflake, server implementations using the Go language, and the development of robust infrastructures powered by AWS.

To guarantee rapid server response and efficiency, I employ advanced techniques such as in-memory caching and make use of tools like Memcached. Furthermore, drawing on the inherent concurrency features of Go, I ensure our servers are not only fast but also optimized for peak performance.

Additionally, I pride myself on my expertise in optimizing and speeding up database systems, particularly with MySQL and DynamoDB. With a holistic approach to system development, I ensure that every component, from data storage to server execution, is honed for excellence.

自然言語処理を用いた推薦システムの構築に従事。

I was deeply involved in tasks pivotal to natural language processing (NLP). My responsibilities included web scraping for data collection tailored for language learning, utilizing MeCab for morphological analysis, and employing tf-idf for word ranking. These tasks were all instrumental in building a recommendation system that leveraged the power of NLP. My role not only allowed me to deepen my expertise in NLP but also to understand the practical application of these techniques in the construction of recommendation engines.
